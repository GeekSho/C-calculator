# Calculator

# Simple Calculator in C

# Overview

This project is a simple calculator program written in the C programming language. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses a `switch` case structure to determine the operation based on user input.

# Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second. Includes error handling for division by zero.

# How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
2. The user is then asked to input two numbers.
3. Based on the operator provided, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
4. The result of the operation is displayed to the user.
5. If an invalid operator is entered, the program notifies the user with an error message.

# Example Usage

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two numbers: 5 3
5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
